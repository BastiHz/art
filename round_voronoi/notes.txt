draw lines connecting neighboring points

Polygons need to be re-calculated every frame. Need to find a way to make it
run fast with many points. More Numpy? Will try scipy.spatial.Voronoi again.
The bottleneck at the moment is the generation of the voronoi and the polygons.
Not the plotting or the corner cutting.

Apply some noise to the cut_ratio and draw the polygons with alpha
to give them a fuzzy edge.

Make a version that returns open polygons for points at the outer edge.

Make sped dependent on current distance to center. For this the move_vectors
must update every frame based on the current position. Or just mulitply by
constant acceleration.
